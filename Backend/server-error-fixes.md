# Server Error Fixes Summary

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve various server errors and improve system stability.

## 1. HTTP Headers Error Fix

**Problem**: `ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT` error occurred when `securityMiddleware.js` attempted to modify HTTP headers after they had already been sent.

**Solution**: Added `if (!res.headersSent)` checks in `Backend/middleware/securityMiddleware.js` to prevent header modification if headers are already sent.

**Files Modified**:
- `Backend/middleware/securityMiddleware.js` - Added header sent checks

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## 2. Redis Connection Issues Fix

**Problem**: Redis connections were closing, leading to WebSocket service failures and critical countdown errors. `client list` showed 68+ connections, many idle, indicating connection leaks.

**Root Cause**: 
- Multiple Redis managers with conflicting configurations
- Connection leaks due to improper connection pooling
- Inconsistent `ioredis` configuration

**Solution**: Created comprehensive Redis connection management:
- `Backend/fixes/redis-connection-fix.js` - Unified Redis manager with connection pooling
- `Backend/scripts/cleanup-redis-connections.js` - Manual cleanup script
- Consistent configuration across all Redis connections

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `Backend/fixes/redis-connection-fix.js` - New unified Redis manager
- `Backend/scripts/cleanup-redis-connections.js` - Cleanup script

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## 3. PlayWin6 API Issues Fix

**Problem**: PlayWin6 API returning 404 errors with message "No games found for the given provider."

**Root Cause**: 
- Missing authentication headers
- Incorrect API endpoints (missing `/api/` prefix)

**Solution**: 
- Added `Authorization: Bearer` and `X-API-Token` headers
- Corrected endpoints from `/providerGame` to `/api/providerGame`
- Created comprehensive configuration fix

**Files Modified**:
- `Backend/config/playwin6Config.js` - Corrected endpoints
- `Backend/utils/playwin6Utils.js` - Added authentication headers
- `Backend/fixes/playwin6-config-fix.js` - Comprehensive configuration

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## 4. BullMQ Connection & Memory Leaks Fix

**Problem**: Database connection pool exhaustion, Redis connection leaks, memory leaks in workers, and transaction timeout issues.

**Root Cause**: 
- Multiple Redis connections for BullMQ components
- Unmanaged intervals in workers causing memory leaks
- Inconsistent worker configuration

**Solution**: Created unified BullMQ management system:
- `Backend/fixes/bullmq-connection-fix.js` - Unified BullMQ manager
- `Backend/scripts/fix-bullmq-workers.js` - Worker management script
- Optimized worker settings and graceful shutdown

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `Backend/fixes/bullmq-connection-fix.js` - New BullMQ manager
- `Backend/scripts/fix-bullmq-workers.js` - Worker management
- `Backend/workers/workerManager.js` - Updated to use new manager

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## 5. BullMQ Worker Integration Fixes

**Problem**: Multiple errors during BullMQ worker integration:
- `TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]` - Promises being passed as worker processors
- `Error: BullMQ: Your redis options maxRetriesPerRequest must be null`
- `TypeError: QueueScheduler is not a constructor`

**Solutions Applied**:
- Defined inline job processor functions in `workerManager.js`
- Set `maxRetriesPerRequest: null` in Redis configuration
- Made QueueScheduler creation optional with error handling

**Files Modified**:
- `Backend/fixes/bullmq-connection-fix.js` - Fixed Redis configuration
- `Backend/workers/workerManager.js` - Fixed worker processor functions

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## 6. Redis Initialization Fix

**Problem**: `Redis manager not initialized` error during server startup and request handling.

**Root Cause**: 
- Queue modules were trying to access Redis connections before the `unifiedRedisManager` was initialized
- The `getConnection` method was throwing an error when `!this.isInitialized`
- Initialization order conflicts between server startup and queue module loading

**Solution**: Fixed the original `unifiedRedisManager` to handle initialization gracefully:
- Modified `getConnection` method to auto-initialize when not initialized
- Updated `queueConfig.js` to use the original `unifiedRedisManager`
- Maintained backward compatibility with all existing code

**Files Modified**:
- `Backend/config/unifiedRedisManager.js` - Added auto-initialization to `getConnection` method
- `Backend/config/queueConfig.js` - Updated to use `unifiedRedisManager`

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## 7. Lazy Loading Pattern Implementation

**Problem**: Queue modules were trying to get Redis connections during module loading, before the `FixedRedisManager` was initialized.

**Solution**: Implemented lazy loading pattern for all BullMQ queues:
- Updated all queue files to export functions instead of direct instances
- Modified all importers to call the new `getQueue()` functions
- Ensured queues are only created when first accessed

**Files Modified**:
- `Backend/config/queueConfig.js` - Added lazy loading comment
- `Backend/queues/*.js` - All queue files converted to lazy loading
- `Backend/controllers/*.js` - Updated to use `getQueue()` functions
- `Backend/queues/*Worker.js` - Updated to use `getQueue()` functions

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Implementation Steps

1. **Apply Redis Fixes**:
   ```bash
   # The fixes are already applied in the codebase
   # No additional steps needed
   ```

2. **Restart Services**:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart strike-backend
   pm2 restart bullmq-worker
   ```

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   ```bash
   pm2 logs strike-backend
   pm2 logs bullmq-worker
   ```

## Expected Results

After applying all fixes:
- ✅ No more `ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT` errors
- ✅ Stable Redis connections without leaks
- ✅ PlayWin6 API working with proper authentication
- ✅ BullMQ workers running with optimized configuration
- ✅ No more "Redis manager not initialized" errors
- ✅ Login and queue operations working normally
- ✅ Improved system performance and stability

## Monitoring

Monitor the following logs for any remaining issues:
- `pm2 logs strike-backend` - Main server logs
- `pm2 logs bullmq-worker` - BullMQ worker logs
- Redis connection count: `redis-cli client list | wc -l`

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check Redis connections: `redis-cli client list`
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure all services are restarted after fixes
4. Monitor memory usage and connection counts
