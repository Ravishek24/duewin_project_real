# DueWin Project Fix Report

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Authentication Middleware Issues

- **Problem**: JWT token payload contained `id` field but controllers expected `user_id`
- **Fix**: Added compatibility code in the auth middleware to map between these fields

### 2. Database Schema Mismatches in WalletRecharge Model

- **Problem**: The application code was using field names that did not match the database schema
  - `transaction_id` field was declared in the model but not present in the database
  - This caused the SQL error: "Unknown column 'transaction_id' in 'field list'"
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed the `transaction_id` field from the WalletRecharge model
  - Updated the indices to match the actual database schema

### 3. Field Name Inconsistencies in WalletServices

- **Problem**: Services were looking for fields that didn't exist in the updated models:
  - Using `added_amount` instead of `amount`
  - Using `payment_status` instead of `status`
  - Using `time_of_success` and other time-related fields instead of `created_at`/`updated_at`
- **Fix**:
  - Updated `getWalletBalance` service to use the correct field names
  - Updated `getTransactionHistory` service to use correct field names
  - Fixed field mappings in `getRechargeHistory` and `getWithdrawalHistory`

### 4. Issues in WalletWithdrawal Model

- **Problem**: Similar to WalletRecharge, the model had fields that didn't match the database schema
- **Fix**: Removed the `transaction_id` field and updated the indices

### 5. Payment Controller Issues

- **Problem**: The payment controller wasn't properly handling payment gateway IDs
- **Fix**: Updated the `payInController` to:
  - Lookup the payment gateway by code to get the correct gateway_id
  - Pass the gateway_id to the payment service functions

## Testing and Validation

Created several diagnostic and testing scripts:

1. `verify-db-connection.js` - To check database connectivity and table structure
2. `verify-models.js` - To verify model field names match the database schema
3. `test-api.js` - To test the APIs after fixes were applied

## Lessons Learned

1. **Field Naming Consistency**: Ensure consistent naming between database schema and ORM models
2. **Authentication Field Mapping**: Add compatibility code when authentication token fields don't match expected controller fields
3. **Testing Framework**: Having diagnostic scripts helped identify and verify fixes to schema issues
4. **Backup Before Changes**: Always create backups before modifying model definitions

## Next Steps

1. Thoroughly test the application in the production environment
2. Consider adding automated tests to prevent regression
3. Update documentation to reflect the correct field names and database schema
