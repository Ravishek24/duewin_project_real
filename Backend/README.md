## OTP Gateway Configuration (Prelude)

To use the Prelude Verify API for OTP delivery, set the following environment variable in your `.env` file:

```
PRELUDE_API_KEY=your_prelude_api_key_here
```

- You can obtain your API key from the Prelude dashboard under Settings > API Keys.
- This key is required for sending and verifying OTPs via the Prelude gateway.
